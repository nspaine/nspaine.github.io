# Architecture Images

This folder contains images for the Architecture gallery page.

## Adding Images

1. Place your architecture photos in this directory
2. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
3. Recommended naming: Use descriptive names (e.g., `brooklyn-bridge.jpg`, `one-world-trade.jpg`)

## Image Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Recommended minimum 1920x1080 for best quality
- **File Size**: Optimize images to keep them under 2MB each for faster loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: Any aspect ratio works, but consistent ratios look better in galleries

## Notes

- Images are automatically loaded from this directory by the Architecture page component
- No need to manually update code when adding/removing images
